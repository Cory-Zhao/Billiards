# Pool Ball Collision Simulation

This code simulates the collision of two balls within a rectangular box, mimicking a pool table environment. The simulation utilizes physics principles to calculate ball collisions and movement. The code is implemented in Python, and the visualization of the simulation is achieved through the use of Matplotlib.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Customization

### Red Ball
- **Initial Position:** Adjust the starting position of the red ball.
- **Initial Velocity:** Modify the initial speed and direction of the red ball.

### Blue Ball
- **Initial Position:** Set the initial position of the blue ball.
- **Initial Velocity:** Change the initial speed and direction of the blue ball.

### Environment
- **Damping Coefficient:** Control the rate at which the balls lose their speed.
- **Friction Coefficient:** Tune the frictional forces affecting ball movement.
- **Wall Dimensions:** Define the size and shape of the rectangular box.

### General
- **Radius of Balls:** Set the size of the balls in the simulation.

Feel free to experiment with different values for these parameters to observe how they impact the simulation.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed before running the code:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
